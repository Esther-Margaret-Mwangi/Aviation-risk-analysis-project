# Aviation-risk-analysis-project

Analysis of historical aviation accident data to identify low-risk aircraft for business investment using data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and interactive visualizations.

# Introduction

The purporse of this project was to help a company that plans to expand in to new industries to diversify its portfolio by purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises.
This project helps to identify the types of aircraft that have the least operational risk based on the dataset obtained from past aviation accidents.

# Data Understanding

The data used was obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains records of aviation accidents that happened in the past. The data is stored in an excel file named flights.csv. The dataset has information about the accident date (acc.date), type of plane (type), aircraft registration (reg),
operator, fatalities (fat), location and damage outcomes (dmg). The dataset is perfect for this analysis since it potrays real word safety performance of different aircrafts.

The dataset has 2500 records of data. One limitation found was that the data didn’t have any information about number of flights per the aircrafts which makes this research focused on the risk patterns instead of accident probabilities which would have been more useful

# Data analysis

The data was cleaned and anylisis was done. Refer to the PDF for better understanding of the project and what was done in the code.

# Data Visualization

A new csv file (cleaned_flight_risk_data.csv) was created which had the cleaned data and other merged columns that would be useful for data visualization part. The data was used in creating the interactive dashboard in tableau.
Here is the link to tableau where you can find the interactive dashboard:
